# This script implements a custom Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for imputing missing data in a dataset,
# assuming the data follows a multivariate normal distribution.
# The process involves these main steps:
# 1. Load the dataset with missing values.
# 2. Select only the numerical columns for imputation, as the EM algorithm described here is based on multivariate normality.
# 3. Initialize the EM algorithm:
#    a. Perform an initial naive imputation of missing values (e.g., using the mean of each column).
#    b. Estimate the initial mean vector and covariance matrix from this naively imputed data.
# 4. Iterate through the Expectation (E-step) and Maximization (M-step) until convergence:
#    a. E-step: For each row with missing values, calculate the conditional expectation of the missing components,
#       given the observed components and the current estimates of the mean and covariance matrix.
#       These expected values are used to fill in the missing data points for this iteration.
#       The `conditional_distribution` helper function is used for this, derived from properties of multivariate normal distributions.
#    b. M-step: Re-estimate the mean vector and covariance matrix from the data that was completed in the E-step.
# 5. Convergence is checked by comparing the change in the imputed data matrix between iterations against a tolerance threshold.
# 6. Once converged, the resulting DataFrame with imputed values (for numeric columns) is returned.
# 7. Merge back any categorical or non-numeric columns that were initially excluded.
# 8. Save the fully imputed dataset to a new CSV file.

"""
Explanation of Code:
Initialization:
The missing values are initially imputed using simple mean imputation to provide a starting point.
E-Step:
For each row with missing values, the conditional expectation of the missing values is computed based on the observed values and the current estimates of the mean and covariance.
M-Step:
After imputing the missing values, the mean and covariance of the entire dataset are updated based on the filled data.
Convergence:
The algorithm checks for convergence by comparing the newly imputed data with the previous iteration. If the change is below a certain threshold (tol), the algorithm stops.
Practical Application:
For a dataset collected from a smart bracelet, which often involves multiple sensor readings such as accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate, etc., this EM-based approach allows 
for a multivariate imputation that takes into account the relationships between the different sensor readings to produce more accurate imputations for missing data.
